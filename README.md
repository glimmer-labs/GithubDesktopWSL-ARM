# GitHub Desktop WSL

Think of it like the [VS Code Remote WSL extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl) but for GitHub Desktop. A fork of [GitHub Desktop](https://github.com/desktop/desktop) that makes WSL repositories work properly — **16-50x faster git operations**, working SSH keys, and no more CRLF issues.

**[Download the latest release](https://github.com/glimmer-labs/GithubDesktopWSL-ARM/releases/latest)** — installs side-by-side with official GitHub Desktop

> This fork of [GithubDesktopWSL](https://github.com/aleixrodriala/GithubDesktopWSL) by [@aleixrodriala](https://github.com/aleixrodriala) adds ARM64 support. GitHub Desktop uses Squirrel.Windows, which does not support shipping multiple architectures in a single release, so the original repository only provides x64 builds. The upstream project remains maintained, and this fork will stay in sync with upstream changes. If you want to contribute or report an issue, please open it in the original repository unless it is ARM-specific.

## The problem

Official GitHub Desktop can't handle repos inside WSL. When you open a `\\wsl.localhost\...` path:

- **Git commands are unusably slow** — Desktop runs Windows `git.exe`, which accesses WSL files through the [9P protocol](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/filesystems). Every file stat, read, and open is a round-trip across the VM boundary.
- **SSH keys don't work** — Desktop injects a Windows-only `SSH_ASKPASS` binary that breaks SSH inside WSL.
- **File operations fail** — Checking merge/rebase state, reading diffs, writing `.gitignore` — all go through 9P and are either slow or broken.
- **Deleting repos fails** — Windows Recycle Bin doesn't support WSL UNC paths.

## The solution

This fork runs a lightweight **daemon inside WSL** that executes git and file operations natively. Desktop talks to it over TCP instead of going through 9P.

```
Official Desktop (slow path):
  Desktop → git.exe → Windows kernel → 9P → VM boundary → WSL → ext4
  (every file operation is a round-trip)

This fork (fast path):
  Desktop → TCP → daemon → git (native) → ext4
  (one round-trip per command, git has direct disk access)
```

The daemon is bundled inside the installer. When you open a WSL repo, it's deployed and started automatically. There's nothing to configure.

## Why a daemon and not a git shim?

The simpler approach is to replace Desktop's bundled `git.exe` with a shim that calls `wsl.exe -e git`. Projects like [wsl-git-bridge](https://github.com/MiloudiMohamed/wsl-git-bridge) and my own earlier [wsl-git-shim](https://github.com/aleixrodriala/wsl-git-shim) do this. It works, but has limitations:

**Spawn overhead** — Every command pays ~92ms to launch `wsl.exe`, even a trivial `git rev-parse`. The daemon is a persistent process, so it has ~2ms overhead (TCP round-trip + framing). Over a typical Desktop refresh cycle (10-20 commands), that's ~1-2 seconds vs ~20-40ms.

**File operations aren't covered** — Desktop doesn't just run git. It also reads diffs, checks merge/rebase state, reads and writes `.gitignore`, checks submodule paths — 8 different files do direct filesystem operations. A git-only shim leaves all of these going through 9P. The daemon handles them natively.

**Breaks on Desktop updates** — Desktop ships its own bundled `git.exe` inside each version's Squirrel package. Every update creates a new `app-<version>` directory with a fresh `git.exe`, so a replaced shim gets wiped. This fork is a separate app — updates come from its own release channel.

| | Daemon (this fork) | Git shim |
|---|---|---|
| Per-command overhead | ~2ms | ~92ms |
| File operations (diffs, merge state, .gitignore) | Native | Still 9P |
| Survives Desktop updates | Yes | No |
| Install | Run installer | Replace git.exe manually |

## Performance

Three ways to run git on a WSL repo, benchmarked across repo sizes:

### Spawn overhead

Before any git work happens, each approach has a fixed cost:

| Approach | Overhead |
|----------|----------|
| Native git (daemon) | 1 ms |
| git.exe (9P) | 46 ms |
| wsl.exe -e (shim) | 94 ms |

### Git operations by repo size

<tr><th></th><th>Daemon</th><th>git.exe (9P)</th><th>Shim</th><th>Daemon</th><th>git.exe (9P)</th><th>Shim</th><th>Daemon</th><th>git.exe (9P)</th><th>Shim</th></tr>

### Real Desktop workflows

These are the actual sequences Desktop runs during common operations:

| Workflow | This fork | Official Desktop | Speedup |
|----------|----------:|-----------------:|--------:|
| Open / switch to a repo | 16 ms | 173 ms | **11x** |
| Populate branch list + dates | 6 ms | 88 ms | **14x** |
| View last commit diff | 4 ms | 44 ms | **10x** |
| Pre-fetch checks | 3 ms | 82 ms | **26x** |

> The "open repo" workflow includes `git status`, `for-each-ref`, 4 `pathExists` checks, `readFile`, and `git log`.

### Why the difference is so large

`git.exe` running on a WSL repo has a ~50ms floor for *any* operation — that's the cost of accessing files through 9P across the VM boundary. A `wsl.exe -e git` shim avoids 9P but pays ~92ms to spawn `wsl.exe` per command — actually slower than 9P for typical Desktop operations. The daemon has ~2ms overhead (TCP round-trip + message framing). The actual git work is the same; the difference is entirely in how commands are dispatched and files are accessed.

A typical Desktop refresh runs 10-20 commands. With git.exe that's 500-1000ms of pure overhead. With a shim it's 920-1840ms. With the daemon it's 20-40ms.

## Install

1. Download **[GitHubDesktopWSLSetup-arm64.exe](https://github.com/glimmer-labs/GithubDesktopWSL-ARM/releases/latest)**
2. Run the installer
3. Open any WSL repository

That's it. The app:
- Detects WSL paths automatically (`\\wsl.localhost\...` or `\\wsl$\...`)
- Deploys the daemon to `~/.local/bin/` in your WSL distro on first use
- Starts the daemon via `--daemonize` (forks to background)
- Reconnects automatically if the daemon crashes
- Falls through to normal Desktop behavior for Windows repos

> SmartScreen may warn on first install (the fork is unsigned). Click "More info" then "Run anyway".

## How it works

### Components

**`wsl-git-daemon`** (C, ~550 lines, zero dependencies)
A persistent daemon that runs inside WSL. Listens on TCP `127.0.0.1` on a random port. Handles:
- Git commands — forks git with proper pipes for stdout/stderr/stdin
- File operations — read, write, stat, pathExists, unlink via direct syscalls
- Security — token-based auth, localhost-only connections

**`wsl.ts`** (TypeScript, ~420 lines)
The Desktop-side client. Responsibilities:
- **Path detection** — identifies `\\wsl.localhost\...` and `\\wsl$\...` paths, extracts distro name
- **Lifecycle management** — deploy binary, start/restart daemon, health check
- **Protocol client** — binary length-prefixed frames over TCP
- **Drop-in wrappers** — `wslReadFile()`, `wslPathExists()`, etc. that route to daemon for WSL paths and fall through to native `fs` for Windows paths

**`core.ts` patch** (1 check)
All git commands in Desktop flow through `git()` in `core.ts`. A single `if (isWSLPath(path))` routes WSL repos through the daemon while leaving Windows repos completely untouched.

### Wire protocol

```
Frame: [type: 1 byte][length: 4 bytes big-endian][payload: N bytes]

Client → Daemon:
  INIT  (0x01)  JSON { token, cmd, args, cwd, stdin, path }
  STDIN (0x02)  Raw bytes (for writeFile content, empty = EOF)

Daemon → Client:
  STDOUT      (0x03)  Raw bytes (git output / file content)
  STDERR      (0x04)  Raw bytes
  EXIT        (0x05)  4-byte exit code
  ERROR       (0x06)  UTF-8 error message
  STAT_RESULT (0x07)  JSON { exists, size, isDir }
```

### Daemon lifecycle

```
User opens WSL repo
  → Desktop detects \\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu\...
  → Extracts distro name ("Ubuntu")
  → Tries to connect to daemon (reads /tmp/wsl-git-daemon.info via UNC path)
  → If not running:
      → Deploys binary: wsl.exe -d Ubuntu -e sh -c "cp ... ~/.local/bin/ && chmod 755 ..."
      → Starts daemon: wsl.exe -d Ubuntu -e sh -c "~/.local/bin/wsl-git-daemon --daemonize"
      → Daemon forks, writes info file, parent exits, wsl.exe returns
      → Desktop reads info file, connects to daemon
  → All git/file operations go through daemon
  → If connection fails mid-session → auto-restart
```

## Staying current with upstream

This project doesn't diverge from upstream GitHub Desktop. It maintains a set of **patch files** (in `patches/`) that are applied on top of each upstream release:

1. CI checks for new upstream `release-*` tags every 6 hours
2. Clones `desktop/desktop` at the new release tag
3. Applies `patches/*.patch` via `git apply`
4. Builds the daemon + app, publishes a new release
5. If patches fail to apply → opens a GitHub Issue for manual resolution

The patches are designed to be minimal and conflict-resistant: one new file (`wsl.ts`), one new directory (`wsl-daemon/`), and small surgical changes to existing files (mostly import swaps). All patches are plain text and easy to review.

```

Most patches are one-line import changes — swapping `readFile` from `fs/promises` with `wslReadFile` from `wsl.ts`. These are unlikely to conflict with upstream changes.
